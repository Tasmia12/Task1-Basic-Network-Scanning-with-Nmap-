Nmap Scan Results and Analysis
This document provides an analysis of an Nmap scan performed on a target machine with the IP address 192.168.56.101. The scan was initiated on Wednesday, September 3, 2025, at 07:29:07 AM, using the command 

nmap --privileged -sV -oN nmap_scan_results.txt 192.168.56.101. The 

-sV flag was used to enable service and version detection, while -oN saved the output to the nmap_scan_results.txt file.

The scan identified that the host is a Linux system and is up and running. A total of 977 closed TCP ports were not shown in the results. The following table summarizes the open ports and services, along with an explanation of their significance.

Port/Protocol	Service	Version	Significance
21/tcp	ftp	vsftpd 2.3.4	This port is used for the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). The version identified, vsftpd 2.3.4, is known to have a backdoor vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to gain remote access to the system.

22/tcp	ssh	OpenSSH 4.7p1	
The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol allows for secure remote administration. An open SSH port is common on Linux servers, but it is a potential target for brute-force attacks if not secured with strong credentials or key-based authentication.

23/tcp	telnet	Linux telnetd		
Telnet provides a remote shell connection. Unlike SSH, Telnet transmits data, including credentials, in plain text, making it highly insecure. This open port represents a significant security risk.

25/tcp	smtp	Postfix smtpd	
This port is used by the 
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending and receiving email. An open SMTP port is normal for a mail server but can be exploited for spam relaying or other malicious activities if not properly configured.

80/tcp	http	Apache httpd 2.2.8	
This is the standard port for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), serving web pages. The presence of Apache httpd 2.2.8 indicates a web server is running. This version is outdated and may contain known vulnerabilities.

139/tcp & 445/tcp	netbios-ssn	Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X	
These ports are used by Samba, which provides file and print services for clients. An outdated Samba version can have vulnerabilities, such as the Shellshock bug, that could allow for remote code execution.

3306/tcp	mysql	MySQL 5.0.51a	This is the default port for the MySQL database.
The open port indicates that a database is accessible on the network, which could be a target for attackers seeking to access or manipulate data.

5432/tcp	postgresql	PostgreSQL DB 8.3.0 - 8.3.7	
This port is used by the PostgreSQL database. Similar to MySQL, this open port makes the database potentially vulnerable to exploitation if it is not properly secured.

1524/tcp	bindshell	Metasploitable root shell	This is a highly critical finding. A bind shell is a type of backdoor that listens on a port, providing remote command execution. The fact that it's identified as a Metasploitable root shell indicates it's a known vulnerability designed for exploitation.

5900/tcp	vnc	VNC (protocol 3.3)		Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote desktop protocol. An open VNC port can allow an attacker to gain full graphical access to the system if a weak or no password is in place.

Summary of Findings
The Nmap scan revealed numerous open ports on the target host, many of which are associated with outdated or misconfigured services. The presence of unencrypted services like Telnet and a known vulnerable FTP version, as well as a pre-existing bind shell, makes this system highly susceptible to attack. The target machine appears to be a Metasploitable virtual machine, a system intentionally designed with various vulnerabilities for security training purposes. This is evidenced by the "Metasploitable" hostname and the identified services.
